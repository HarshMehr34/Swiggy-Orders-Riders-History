# Swiggy-Orders-Riders-History
This project analyzes the relationship between First-Mile Distance (driver-to-restaurant) and Order Assignment Latency to identify bottlenecks in the delivery dispatch lifecycle. By analyzing thousands of data points for both delivered and cancelled orders, the study aims to optimize driver dispatching logic and reduce order churn.
